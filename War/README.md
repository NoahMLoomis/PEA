# nloomis_G30_A03_Stacks_Queues

Game of War, played with 2 players, using stacks and queues

## How to Play:
In each round, each player turns up the top card of his pile. The player with the higher-ranking cards takes both cards and adds them to the bottom of his pile. A tie is resolved by a "war": each player plays three cards from his pile face-down and another face-up. The high card among these two last wins all ten cards. Subsequent ties are handled similarly, with the eventual winner of the round taking an even larger pile of cards.
